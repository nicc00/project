<h1>Proposal</h1>
<body>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h6>
    <p>I plan to create a collection of my favorite movies. It will be somewhat like a blog where I post information on some movies that I recommend.</p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h3>
    <p>I hope this website will help people who are interested in watching movies but don't know where to start. I want to provide my own personal recommenations.</p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>
    <p>My target audience are people who are interested in movies but don't watch them very often.</p>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>I will include the movie with ways to watch, various ratings, images and perhaps trailers as well. I don't want to spoil movies by providing in-depth reviews so I will refrain from that.</p>
